<h3>Considerations</h3>

  - Engaging game backstory and messaging
  - Handling user flow with
      - option to retry
      - skip intro after first attempt
      - valid name insertion
      - score update on leaderboard for same user
      - top 5 leaderboard with yourself reflected independent of score
  - Separated game content (messages, values) from game logic to ease potential future changes to content (eg. localization, game balancing, improve user experience)
